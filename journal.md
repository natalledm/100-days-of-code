## Day 28: 11, February 2021 (JS)

## Day 29: 12, February 2021 (JS)

**Thoughts:** -

## Day 30: 13, February 2021 (JS)

**Today's progress:** Class and functions!

**Thoughts:** Capital letter for naming a file (ex: "Client.js") to specify that it is a file for a Class. Better practice to initialize a variable inside a method.
Also, leave a space to separate public variables from private variables. Private atribute convention: underline at the beginning (or #, as the proposition below).

**Resources and Inspirations:**[Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/), [Private Fields proposition](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields#private-fields)

## Day 31: 14, February 2021 (REGEX, Pink Programming)

**Today's progress:** Understanding Regex and being inspired by Pink Programming!

**Thoughts:** -

**Resources and Inspirations:**[Pink Programming](https://www.pinkprogramming.se/en/), [Regex](https://regex101.com/)

## Day 32: 15, February 2021 (JS)

**Today's progress:** Classes, modules, and objects!

**Thoughts:** Remember that if you use an object as parameter of a method, it uses the original object itself. So any changes will be done to the original object! Objects are not primitive values (string, int, etc.) so when referred as a value of a method what is referred is the object itself, not a copy of it like it occurs with a primitive value. So any changes in the object inside the method, will change the original object itself. Ex: if I put a "thing: value", it will appear in the object that is being called by the function.

## Day 33: 16, February 2021 (JS)

**Today's progress:** More about objects, null and undefined.

**Thoughts:** Slow day today.

**Resources and Inspirations:**[Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/)

## Day 34: 17, February 2021 (JS)

**Today's progress:** Classes, getters and constructors.

**Thoughts:** Dead dead. Getters can be used to make a variable only readable, so you can't change it directly, only using the methods inside the class.

**Resources and Inspirations:**[Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/)

## Day 35: 18, February 2021 (JS)

**Today's progress:** Continuing the bank project from yesterday. Now it was connecting classes via extends.

**Thoughts:** Classes are still strange to me.

**Resources and Inspirations:**[Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/)

## Day 36: 19, February 2021 (JS)

**Today's progress:** Super and overwrite methods.

**Thoughts:** Write a method in a specialized class with the same name and parameters that is on the "main" class to overwritten it and use it instead of the original method inside the main class.

**Resources and Inspirations:**[Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/)

## Day 37: 20, February 2021 (JS)

**Today's progress:** Abstract class, a bit of throw error and abstract method.

**Thoughts:** Abstract Class = only works for inheritance, not to be instanced. Abstract method = created to be overwritten.
