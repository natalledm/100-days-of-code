# Day 1: 15, January 2021 (HTML, CSS, Git and Github)

**Today's progress:** Finished HTML and CSS on Freecodecamp. Relearning Git and Github.

**Thoughts:** I am more rusty on programming than I remembered. I can only imagine the struggle with js that will come.

**Resources and Inspirations:** [Freecodecamp](freecodecamp.org), [Brittany Walker](https://code.likeagirl.io/100-days-of-code-challenge-completed-bbce87f04c00)
