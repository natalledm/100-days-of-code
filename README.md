# 100-days-of-code

This was a long ride!

I had to battle the idea of doing something for show, because I did this challenge to prove to myself I could study at least one hour every single day.
This was not to build a portifolio, but to prove I have resilience and energy if I commit to what I chose.

*And I did it!* ;)

## What I learned from this

* I managed to maintain the study even in terrible, awlful days

* There are a lot of different things to study and even more skills to learn in order to enter the programming world

* I can do anything if I put the effort to do it (this challenge proves it)

## What I recommend after doing this challenge

  Understand **why** you want to do this and remember it.
  Everything else is a bonus. :)
